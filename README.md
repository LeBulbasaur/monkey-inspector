## Introduction

This website allows users to upload a photo of a monkey by using the drag and drop mechanic. Once the photo is uploaded, the website will use image recognition technology to identify the species of the monkey in the photo and redirect the user to a page with information about that specific species. Its written in React with Typescript language support.

## How to Use
1.	Open the website in your preferred browser.
2.	Drag and drop an image of a monkey into the designated area on the homepage.
3.	The website will automatically process the image and identify the species of monkey in the photo.
4.	Once the species has been identified, the user will be redirected to a page with information about that specific species of monkey.

## Technical Details
